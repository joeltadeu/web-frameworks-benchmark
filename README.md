# Comparing Web Frameworks and Testing Performance

## Overview

The objective of this project was to compare the best known frameworks for java language such as Spring Boot, Micronaut and Quarkus, C# with .Net/API Core, Rust with Actix and Rocket
creating an api for querying books using different forms of persistence such as JDBC, Hibernate and Reactive, Entity Framework, Diesel.

It was also possible to carry out an extensive performance test using the Gatling tool simulating the simultaneous access of 100 to 500 users for 10 minutes.

Below is the list of created microservices:

Each project has its own docker-compose and can run independently.

Projects were also created to assist in the creation of the database, in the execution of performance tests and in the display of consolidated results.

## Comparing Analysis

### Compiled size

The .Net microservice with Entity Framework is the smallest compiled at 17.2 MB. The spring boot microservice with hibernate has the largest compiled with 43.66 MB, approximately 154% larger than the smallest.

### Container Size

The .Net microservice with Entity Framework has the smallest container size at 118 MB. The quarkus microservice with hibernate has the largest container with 444 MB, approximately 276% larger than the smallest.

### Used Memory - start container

In the graph below we have a comparison of the memory used when uploading the container of each microservice. .Net with Entity Framework has the lowest initial memory footprint at 66 MB. The spring boot microservice with hibernate had the highest memory consumption with 264.3 MB, approximately 300% higher than the lowest.

### Used Memory - 100 users in 10 min

In the graph below we have a comparison of memory usage simulating the access of 100 simultaneous users for 10 minutes. Spring boot with JDBC had the lowest memory footprint at 690 MB. The quarkus microservice with hibernate had the highest memory consumption with 4.63 GB, approximately 571% higher than the lowest consumption.

### Used Memory - 500 users in 10 min

In the graph below we have a comparison of memory usage simulating the access of 500 simultaneous users for 10 minutes. Quarkus with Reactive had the lowest memory consumption at 400 MB but that's because it wasn't able to respond to requests. Thus, we consider that the Micronaut Reactive microservice had the lowest memory consumption with 2.19 GB. The quarkus microservice with jdbc had the highest memory consumption with 4.62 GB, approximately 110% higher than the lowest consumption.
